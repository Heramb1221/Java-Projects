Encryption Program

Description
This Java program demonstrates a simple encryption and decryption mechanism using a shuffled list of ASCII characters. It allows users to generate a new encryption key, encrypt a message using the generated key, decrypt an encrypted message back to its original form, and display the current encryption key.

Features
New Key Generation: Generates a new encryption key by shuffling ASCII characters from space (ASCII 32) to tilde (ASCII 126).
Key Display: Displays the current encryption key and its shuffled version.
Encryption: Encrypts user-provided messages using the shuffled key.
Decryption: Decrypts encrypted messages back to their original form using the shuffled key.
User Interaction: Utilizes console input to interact with the program, offering options to perform different operations.

How to Use
Run the Encryption class from the Main method.
Follow the console prompts:
Press N to generate a new encryption key.
Press G to display the current encryption key and its shuffled version.
Press E to encrypt a message. Enter the message when prompted.
Press D to decrypt a message. Enter the encrypted message when prompted.
Press Q to quit the program.
