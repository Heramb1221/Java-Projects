The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.
The snake grows in length each time it eats an apple.
Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.
Upon game over, the final score is displayed along with a "Game Over" message.
